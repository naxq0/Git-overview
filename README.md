# German Vocab Helper #
#######################
Learning German can be challenging and I wanted a way to automate looking up lists of vocabulary. This script uses the online dictionary "Leo Dictionary" to find the definitions of a list of words saved as a .txt file

# Getting the subway times from the MVG and displaying them with a raspberry PI #
#################################################################################

In Munich, there is no public API for the real-time timings of the public transport system. However, these times are being tracked and can be seen on a website:
http://www.mvg-live.de/MvgLive/MvgLive.jsp

This website uses JavaScript to generate a table with the response to the information provided by the user.

My goal was to use a Raspberry Pi to get that information and use an LCD display to display it in my house, so that I never miss another U-bahn again
